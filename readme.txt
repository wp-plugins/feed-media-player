This plugin adds a static music player to your Wordpress blog. 

== Description ==

This plugin adds a static music player to your Wordpress blog. 

The player pulls music from feed.fm, where you can upload the music you want to play
or you can select music from stations already published on fuzz.com.

The player wraps your website so that as users navigate between pages the music keeps
playing. Because some more recent browser features are used to make this work (history
API, audio API) the player only appears on modern browsers.

== Installation ==

1. Install the feed-media-player vis the WordPress.org directory or by uploading the
   feed-media-player.zip to your server.
1. Register with 'developer.feed.fm' to select the look and feel of your music player
   and select or upload the music that you want played.
1. In your wp settings for this plugin, enter the authentication credentials given to
   you on the 'developer.feed.fm' site.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Rock out!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this free? =

You can try this out for free, but then it costs around $25/month for 15,000 minutes of play
time.

= What music can I play? =

Any published songs. You can upload songs to our service, or you can select one of thousands
of stations that already exist on fuzz.com.

= Is this legal? =

Feed.fm follows the same DMCA rules for Internet radio that companies like Pandora adhere to.
We make payments to SoundExchange and the various performing rights organizations.

= Can everybody listen to this music? =

Currently only US visitors to your website will see the music player and be able to listen to
music.

= Does this page wrapping technique mess with my SEO? =

No, the pages in your website look the same to search engines as they always have.

== Screenshots ==

1. The `slider` skin starts out as a headphone icon on the side of the screen, and slides
   out to expose player controls.
1. The `simple` skin is understated and displays well in multiple browsing environments.
1. The `grille` skin makes a statement.
