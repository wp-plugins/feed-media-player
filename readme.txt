Enhance your WordPress site with popular music - from Beatles to Daft Punk - in minutes! 

== Description ==

Feed.fm (Music as a Service) provides a legal turn-key API to add popular music to websites, apps, and games 
n order to drive engagement, retention, and revenues. With the Music Player plugin, you can enhance your
Wordpress site with music from your own personal collection, or you can select from Feed.fm's wide array
of expertly curated stations. 

The Music Player plugin integrates seamlessly with Wordpress, and comes with a selection of skins to fit the look
and feel of your site. The player wraps your website so that music keeps playing even as users navigate from
page to page. Because some more recent browser features are used to make this work (history API, audio API)
the player only appears on modern browsers.

Music is a powerful retention, engagement, and branding tool. With a Feed.fm account, you can use our dashboard
to track session times, return visits, conversions, and more to better understand your audience. An A/B test
environment is available to find the best music solution for your site.

*note*: Due to licensing restrictions, Feed.fm can only stream music to listeners in the United States.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Music Player via the WordPress.org directory or by uploading the
   feed-media-player.zip to your server.
1. The plugin will immediately add music to your site upon activation.
1. Follow the instructions that come up after activating the plugin to create
   an account on Feed.fm to customize the player and select the music you
   want it to play.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this free? =

Installation is free, but you are charged a fraction of a cent per minute of music playback.
New accounts on Feed.fm are given free minutes so you can try the service out for no cost.

= What music can I play? =

Any published songs. You can upload songs to our service, or you can select one of thousands
of stations that already exist on fuzz.com.

= Is this legal? =

Feed.fm follows the same DMCA rules for Internet radio that companies like Pandora adhere to.
We make payments to SoundExchange and the various performing rights organizations.

Currently only US visitors to your website will see the music player and be able to listen to
music.

= Does this page wrapping technique mess with my SEO? =

No, the pages in your website look the same to search engines as they always have.

== Screenshots ==

   out to expose player controls.
1. The `simple` skin is understated and displays well in multiple browsing environments.
1. The `grille` skin makes a statement.
